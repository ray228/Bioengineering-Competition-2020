# Bioengineering-Competition-2020

As part of the Bioengineering 2020 Competition in college, our team's goal was to propose a way to reduce germ transmission in public transit. 
We came up with this idea of having a web-based booking service. Riders get to book their seats on the public transportation method of their choice at least 2 hours before their ride. 
This would reduce wait times in bus/train stations and would ensure physical distancing is respected on public transit.
